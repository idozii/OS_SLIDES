# Simple Operating System

Implementation of a basic OS with Scheduling & Memory Management

---

## Introduction

- Modern computing requires efficient resource management
- Operating systems coordinate hardware resources and execution flow
- This project implements core OS components:
  - Process Scheduler
  - Paging-based Memory Management

---

## Project Overview

- **Scheduler**: Determines which process executes on the CPU
- **Memory Management**: Provides virtual memory spaces for processes
- **Synchronization**: Coordinates resource access between processes

---

## Key Learning Goals

- Understanding OS design principles
- Implementing scheduling algorithms
- Building paging-based memory management
- Handling process synchronization

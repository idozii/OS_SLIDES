# Synchronization

---

## Critical Section Protection

- **Mutex Implementation**: Guards shared data structures
- **Lock Granularity**: Balances performance and safety
- **Race Condition Prevention**: Atomic operations where needed

## Multi-CPU Coordination

- **Thread-safe Queue Operations**: Prevents corruption during parallel access
- **Preemption Control**: Ensures scheduler state consistency
- **Priority Inversion Avoidance**: Prevents blocking of high-priority processes
